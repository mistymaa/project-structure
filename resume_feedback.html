      <!-- I understand what you're trying to do here, but headers aren't
           really used to style content. A simple 'p' would have been 
           fine here for your phone number and email address. You could
           have contained the address in an address tag.

           Also the p tags between each header is unnecessary. 

           A lot of this looks like it was done for looks, not 
           necessarily to describe the information. Remember, this can
           all be styled using CSS in exactly the way you want it to
           look.

           You can use an 'a' tag to create a link for your address which
           would allow someone to click on it and send you an email. You 
           should still look into how one does that, but that method is a 
           way spammers harvest email addresses, so... instead, try using
           http://hivelogic.com/enkoder/ to include a link to your
           email address.

      <!-- A couple things...

           The links do not work because they are not being directed
           anywhere - - kind of like being sent into a black hole. For
           each section you are linking to, you should include an 
           'a' tag with an id of the corresponding value.

           I'll note this below.

           As for the Home item, I like your thinking, although it may
           not be neccessary here. But I guarantee it will be something
           you will include as you build bigger sites. Good to be 
           thinking ahead.

           If you ad this to each section, with the appropriate value,
           when a user clicks on a link in your navigation, it will

           styles.)
